## Restaurant Application

- This is Full stack Restaurant app built using MERN Stack. I have created my own server using NodeJS and ExpressJS and MongoDB(noSQL database) as database to store the information.

- App is designed to use for a particular restaurants with franchise so the customers can choose there nearest location.

- Customers can reserver tables on a particular date and time using valid email and phone number.

### To run the app 

- Clone or download repository and run npm install in both frontend and backend separately

- First run backend using npm start and then frontend with same command

- Note - Frontend will only work when backend/server is running

- Also update the port address and db address according to your machine
